Java Final project 1ยบ DAW (BAC+1)

The main goal of this app is creating new experiences for users/customers.
First of all, you must sign up before using the app, then sign in with your own user is mandatory in case you want to enter.
Emphasize the whole interface has been designed thanks JavaFX.
The program uses data storaged in a data-base. Here we keep all the information like, for instance, users (with encrypted passwords), activities in Malaga, user's packs, detailed user's activities, etc.
We can switch between windows and stages, offering us a great experience in order to complete our own holydays pack. Once we finished, we have the possibility to remove or clean the shopping cart or even, some activities into it in case we regret the choice.
Finally, once we are decided, we can finish our pack by clicking "Purchase". In addition, we notify that purchase and the creation of our own PDF ticket, storaged in a folder of our project "tickets".
The whole app is created by information which is storaged in a data-base, we load it in execution in an effective way.
Also, emphasize we can filter by price or quality stars the activities we want to show.
Since our app has different roles (clients and admins), the option of creating, modifying or deleting activities is just available for admin users.
These sections offer us the ease to create, modify or remove content in our app, saving it automatically in our data-base.

We use some external libraries such as iText for PDF tickets, ControlsFX or JFoenix for new components or even libraries to encrypt data.

I recommend you the use of this app in case you are starting to learn Java, here you will see the basics of this beatiful language.
